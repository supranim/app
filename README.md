**What / Why Nim?**<br>
_Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. [Find out more about Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)_

Performance, fast compilation and C-like freedom. I want to keep code clean, readable, concise, and close to my intention. Also a very good language to learn in 2021.
